* don't allow a type to use a type from a different namespace, unless the scope of the other namespace is "global".
    default scope is private.
    
 habit validations
    no circular base references
    no duplicate names
    etc...
 
 add nested properties back to schema
    "properties":
        "a": "string"
        "b": "string"
        "c":
            "properties":
                "x": "string"
                "y": "string"

 validate yml structure and contents
    optional[] and secrets[] ust have valid propertyy names
    make sure node name are valid at every level
 
 

DONE: properties: required/optional
DONE: json merger 
DONE: validation
DONE doesn't mean it's actually done... just DONE enough for immediate needs


still not comfortable with the json merger, and the configinator GetValue method that uses it.

lots of cancellation tokens
