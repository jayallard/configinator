* don't allow a type to use a type from a different namespace, unless the scope of the other namespace is "global".
    default scope is private.
    
 habit validations
    no circular base references
    no duplicate names
    etc...
 
 add nested properties back to schema
    "properties":
        "a": "string"
        "b": "string"
        "c":
            "properties":
                "x": "string"
                "y": "string"
    the nested property c used to be supported, but i removed it because it doesn't have a type.
    it doen't need to have a type, though... it's just an object with more properties.
    it'll just be a proeprty group.
 
 

DONE: properties: required/optional
DONE: json merger 
DONE: validation
DONE doesn't mean it's actually done... just DONE enough for immediate needs
